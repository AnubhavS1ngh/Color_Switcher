# Color_Switcher
Overview
This simple web application, titled "Color Scheme Switcher," allows users to change the background color of the page by clicking on different color buttons. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
You will see a canvas with the heading "Color Scheme Switcher" and four color buttons below it.
Click on any of the color buttons to change the background color of the page.
Code Structure
HTML (index.html)
The HTML file contains the structure of the web page with a canvas div, a heading (<h1>), four color buttons (<span> elements with class "button" and unique IDs), and a subheading (<h2>).
CSS (style.css)
The CSS file (style.css) provides styling for the web page, setting the initial background color, fonts, and layout. The color buttons have specific styles based on their IDs.
JavaScript (script.js)
The JavaScript file (script.js) handles the interactivity of the color buttons. It selects all buttons and the body element and adds click event listeners to each button.
When a button is clicked, the background color of the body is changed based on the button's ID.

Grey (#grey): Changes the background color to grey.
White (#white): Changes the background color to white.
Blue (#blue): Changes the background color to blue.
Yellow (#yellow): Changes the background color to yellow.
Customization
Feel free to customize the colors, styles, and layout based on your preferences. You can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to add more features or enhance the existing ones.
